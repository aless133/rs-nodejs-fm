# File Manager
https://github.com/AlreadyBored/nodejs-assignments/blob/main/assignments/file-manager/assignment.md

* Supported commands listed in link above
* All commands support filenames or path to directory/file with spaces, you have to double quote it to use, for example `cd "c:\program files"`
* `path_to_new_directory` in exactly path to directory. If you'll try `c:\my-dir\my-file.txt` here, we'll try to copy/move file to `c:\my-dir\my-file.txt\<original filename here>`
* `new_file_name` in `add` command and `new_filename` in `rn` command are just filenames without path
* Compress/decompress commands need 2 paths to files (`path_to_file` and `path_to_destination`), you have to name them yourself
