# File Manager
https://github.com/AlreadyBored/nodejs-assignments/blob/main/assignments/file-manager/assignment.md

* Supported commands listed in link above
* All commands support filenames or path to directory/file with spaces, you have to double quote it to use, for example `cd "c:\program files"`
* `new_file_name` in `add` command and `new_filename` in `rn` command are just filenames without path
* Compress/decompress commands need 2 path to files, you have to name them yourself
